# A US-based housing company Advanced Linear Regression.
> The following Repository contains the analysis of the US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. So the company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. And Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- The repository usually contains of jupyter notebook and the subjective questions regarding the notebook of jupyter.
- The main background of this project is to know thw affect of prices based on the house in Australia.
- The business problem is basically solving the issue of the variables which affect the most in deciding the house price.
- The dataset named 'train.csv' file of excel sheet was used to analyze the dataset to solve the issue of the business of US-based housing company.

## Conclusions
After creating model in both Ridge and Lasso we can see that the r2_scores are almost same for both of them but as lasso will penalise more on the dataset and can also help in feature elimination. Therefore, we are going to consider that as our final model.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplot lib, sklearn & statsmodel, math, Ridge, Lasso Regressions
- Here all the packages were already installed into the anaconda libraries.

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
